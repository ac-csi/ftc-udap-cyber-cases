# FTC Enforcement Actions Against Unfair and Deceptive Cyber Practices

Read the report [here](https://dfrlab.org/2024/06/12/forty-seven-cases-ftc-cyber/).

This repo provides the utils scripts and the data used for this analysis. The two folders complaints_txts and orders_txts contain the text file versions of the orders (fair warning, they are not perfectly cleaned -- we added a cleaning step in our analysis). You can experiment with regenerating these using the get_pdfs and scrape_pdf_text scripts. 

The search_keyword script allows you to search for keywords within the files (it is case-insensitive). 

If you have any questions, please reach out to the authors: mhamin@atlanticcouncil.org, nmessieh@atlanticcouncil.org, and iwright@atlanticcouncil.org.
