In the Matter of

CHEGG, INC., a corporation, 

      DOCKET NO.  C-4782

________________________________________________ 

COMPLAINT 

The Federal Trade Commission, having reason to believe that Chegg, Inc., a corporation, 

has violated the provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and it appearing to the 
Commission that this proceeding is in the public interest, alleges: 

Respondent Chegg, Inc. (“Chegg”) is a Delaware corporation with its principal office or 

1. 
place of business at 3990 Freedom Circle, Santa Clara, CA 95054. 

Chegg markets and sells direct-to-student educational products and services.  Its 

2. 
“Required Materials” service includes selling and renting textbooks to students.  Its “Chegg 
Services” products and services include online learning aids, such as online tutoring, writing 
assistance, a math-problem solver, and answers to common textbook questions.  Chegg has 
asserted that the target audience for its services are primarily high school and college students. 

The acts and practices of Chegg alleged in this complaint have been in or affecting 
3. 
commerce, as “commerce” is defined in Section 4 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. 

Data Security 

In providing its services, Chegg collects sensitive personal information from users.  For 

4. 
example, in connection with its scholarship search service, Chegg has collected information 
about a user’s religious denomination, heritage, date of birth, parents’ income range, sexual 
orientation, and disabilities (collectively, the “Scholarship Search Data”).  In a 2018 internal 
email, Chegg’s employee in charge of cybersecurity described the Scholarship Search Data as 
“very sensitive.” 

As another example, in connection with its online tutoring services, Chegg recorded 

5. 
videos of tutoring sessions that included Chegg users’ images and voices. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Chegg has also collected sensitive personal information from its employees in the course 

6. 
of employment.  This includes employees’ names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and 
financial information. 

Chegg’s Amazon S3 Storage 

As part of its information technology infrastructure, Chegg uses a third-party service 

7. 
provided by Amazon Web Services called the Simple Storage Service (“S3”).  S3 is a scalable 
cloud storage service that can be used to store and retrieve large amounts of data.  The S3 stores 
data inside virtual containers, called “buckets,” against which individual access controls can be 
applied. 

8. 
Chegg relies on S3 buckets to store a wide variety of files that contain users’ sensitive 
personal information, including their names, passwords, dates of birth, and Scholarship Search 
Data (collectively, the “S3 User Data”). 

Chegg’s Lax Security Practices 

From at least 2017 to the present, Chegg has engaged in a number of practices that, taken 

9. 
individually or together, failed to provide reasonable security to prevent unauthorized access to 
users’ personal information.  These shortcomings also failed to provide reasonable security for 
the personal information Chegg collects from its employees, which has similarly resulted in 
unauthorized access to that information.  Among other things, Chegg: 

a) 

failed to implement reasonable access controls to safeguard users’ personal 
information stored in S3 databases until at earliest October 2018. Specifically, 
Chegg: 

i)  failed to require employees and third-party contractors that access the S3 
databases to use distinct access keys, instead permitting employees and 
contractors to use a single AWS access key that provided full administrative 
privileges over all data in the S3 databases (“AWS Root Credentials”); 

ii)  failed to restrict access to systems based on employees’ or contractors’ job 

functions; 

iii) failed to require multi-factor authentication for account access to the S3 

databases; and 

iv)  failed to rotate access keys to the S3 databases; 

b) 

c) 

stored users’ and employees’ personal information on Chegg’s network and 
databases, including S3 databases, in plain text, rather than encrypting the 
information; 

used, until at least April 2018, outdated and unsecure cryptographic hash 
functions to protect users’ passwords;

d) 

e) 

f) 

g) 

failed, until January 2021, to develop, implement, or maintain adequate written 
organizational information security standards, policies, procedures, or practices; 

failed, until at earliest April 2020, to provide adequate guidance or training for 
employees or third-party contractors regarding information security and 
safeguarding users’ and employees’ personal information, including, but not 
limited to, failing to require employees to complete any data security training; 

failed to have a policy, process, or procedure for inventorying and deleting users’ 
and employees’ personal information stored on Chegg’s network after that 
information is no longer necessary; and 

failed to adequately monitor its networks and systems for unauthorized attempts 
to transfer or exfiltrate users’ and employees’ personal information outside of 
Chegg’s network boundaries. 

Chegg’s Security Failures Led to Multiple Breaches 

Chegg’s failure to provide reasonable security for the personal information it collected 

10. 
from users and employees has led to the repeated exposure of that personal information. 

In or around September 2017, Chegg employees fell for a phishing attack, giving the 

11. 
threat actors access to employees’ direct deposit information.  Prior to the hack, Chegg did not 
require employees to complete any data security training, including identifying and appropriately 
responding to phishing attacks; this failure contributed to the security incident. 

In or around April 2018, a former contractor accessed one of Chegg’s S3 databases using 

12. 
an AWS Root Credential.  Although Amazon had provided public guidance to protect AWS 
Root Credentials “like you would your credit card numbers or any other sensitive secret” and 
that Amazon “strongly recommend[s] that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks, 
even the administrative ones,” Chegg shared the AWS Root Credentials among its employees 
and even outside contractors.  Using the AWS Root Credentials, the former contractor exfiltrated 
a database containing personal information of approximately 40 million users of the Chegg 
platform.  The exposed personal information included the S3 User Data consisting of users’ 
email addresses, first and last names, passwords, and, for certain Chegg users, their Scholarship 
Search Data, consisting of their religious denomination, heritage, date of birth, parents’ income 
range, sexual orientation, and disabilities.  Although Chegg had stored passwords in a hashed 
format—appearing as a random set of numbers and letters based on a cryptographic tool—it had 
stored the remaining information in plain text in the S3 database.  Moreover, Chegg encrypted 
users’ passwords using the MD5 hash function, a cryptographic function that had been 
deprecated by experts for years prior to April 2018.  Had Chegg employed reasonable access 
controls and monitoring, it would have likely detected and/or stopped the attack more quickly. 

In September 2018, a threat intelligence vendor informed Chegg that a file containing 

13. 
some of the exfiltrated information was available in an online forum.  Chegg reviewed the file as 
part of its own investigation, finding it held, among other things, approximately 25 million of the 
exfiltrated passwords in plain text, meaning the threat actors had cracked the hash for those 
passwords.  Chegg required approximately 40 million Chegg platform users to reset their

passwords.  And, while Chegg implemented some access controls—rotating credentials and 
creating credentials with access permissions tailored to an employee’s job functions—it failed to 
address, and allowed to persist, the remaining data securities failures laid out in sub-Paragraphs 
9.b-e.  For example, Chegg continues to store consumer personal information in plain text in its 
AWS S3 buckets. 

In or around April 2019, a senior Chegg executive fell victim to a phishing attack, giving 

14. 
the threat actor access to the executive’s credentials to Chegg’s email platform and exposing 
personal information about consumers and employees of Chegg.  This executive’s email system 
was in a default configuration state that allowed employees, as well as threat actors, to bypass 
Chegg’s multifactor authentication requirement while accessing the email platform.  The threat 
actor exploited this shortfall and gained access to the executive’s email inbox, which contained 
the personal information of Chegg users and employees, including their financial and medical 
information.  If Chegg had appropriately configured its systems to ensure that employee access 
to the email platform required the employee to go through Chegg’s multifactor authentication 
process, this phishing attack, and the resulting exposure of consumer and employee personal 
information, could have been stopped.  In addition, Chegg’s failure to require employees to 
complete any data security training, including training to identify and respond to phishing 
attacks, contributed to the security incident. 

In or around April 2020, Chegg’s senior employee responsible for payroll fell victim to a 

15. 
phishing attack, giving the threat actor access to the employee’s credentials to Chegg’s payroll 
system.  The threat actor exfiltrated the W-2 information, including the birthdates and Social 
Security numbers, of approximately 700 current and former employees.  Despite Chegg 
employees falling victim to phishing attacks on at least two prior occasions, Chegg still did not 
require, in or before April 2020, its employees to complete any data security training, including 
identifying and appropriately responding to phishing attacks. 

Injury to Consumers 

The information collected by Chegg, including users’ and employees’ medical conditions 

16. 
and financial information, together with identifying information such as their names, email 
addresses, passwords, birthdates, and Social Security numbers, is highly sensitive. 

17. 
Chegg’s failure to provide reasonable security for users’ and employees’ personal 
information has caused or is likely to cause substantial injury to those users and employees in the 
form of fraud, identity theft, monetary loss, stigma, embarrassment, emotional distress, and time 
spent remedying or attempting to prevent any of these potential injuries. 

18. 
In particular, medical and financial information is valuable on the open market, and 
wrongdoers frequently seek to purchase users’ financial and health information on the dark web. 
This information is often used to commit identity theft and fraud.  For example, identity thieves 
use stolen names, addresses, and Social Security numbers to apply for credit cards in the victim’s 
name. When the identity thief fails to pay credit card bills, the victim’s credit suffers. 

19. 
In addition, because people often use the same email addresses and passwords for 
multiple accounts, exposure of such user credentials open users up to additional attacks by threat 

4 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
actors, including credential stuffing attacks.  A credential stuffing attack is when a threat actor 
uses stolen credentials from one website to access user accounts on a different website.  Thus, for 
example, a threat actor could use the email address and cracked passwords exfiltrated from the 
Chegg S3 bucket that the threat intelligence vendor found in the online forum to attempt to 
access the users’ financial accounts on other websites. 

Even if identity theft and fraud do not occur immediately after a breach, a breach of 

20. 
personal information such as that stored in Chegg’s system makes identity theft and fraud more 
likely in the future. 

Furthermore, due to Chegg’s failure to appropriately monitor its systems and lack of 

21. 
access controls and authentication protections for its S3 databases, users’ and employees’ 
personal information, including health information and financial information, may have been 
exposed in other instances—beyond the incidents described in Paragraphs 11-15—without 
Chegg’s knowledge. 

22. 
The harms described in Paragraphs 16-21 were not reasonably avoidable by users or 
employees, as users had no way to know about Chegg’s information security shortcomings. 

Further, the harms are not outweighed by any countervailing benefits to users or 

23. 
competition.  Chegg could have prevented or mitigated these information security failures 
through readily available, and relatively low-cost, measures.  For example, as part of its AWS 
service, Amazon offers server-side encryption that encrypts data at rest (such as the S3 User 
Data) using encryption keys managed by Amazon. 

Chegg’s Deceptive Security Statements 

From at least March 2017 to January 2020, Chegg disseminated, or caused to be 

24. 
disseminated, a privacy policy that expressly applied to Chegg’s websites, apps, and other 
services.  During this time period, the privacy policy contained the following claim regarding the 
security measures Chegg used to protect the personal information it collected from users: “Chegg 
takes commercially reasonable security measures to protect the Personal Information submitted 
to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.” 

From January 2020 to the present, Chegg’s privacy policy contained the following 

25. 
statement concerning that same personal information: “We take steps to ensure that your 
information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.” 

Count I 
Unfair Data Security Practices 

As described in Paragraphs 16-23, Chegg’s failure to employ reasonable and appropriate 

26. 
measures to protect personal information caused or is likely to cause substantial injury to 
consumers that is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition and is 
not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves.  This practice is an unfair act or practice.

Count II 
Data Security Misrepresentations 

27. 
As described in Paragraphs 24-25, Chegg has represented, directly or indirectly, 
expressly or by implication, that it implemented reasonable measures to protect personal 
information against unauthorized access. 

In fact, as set forth in Paragraph 9, Chegg did not implement reasonable measures to 

28. 
protect personal information against unauthorized access.  Therefore, the representation set forth 
in Paragraph 27 is false or misleading. 

Violations of Section 5 

The acts and practices of Respondent as alleged in this complaint constitute unfair or 

29. 
deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal 
Trade Commission Act. 

THEREFORE, the Federal Trade Commission this 25th day of January, 2023, has 

issued this Complaint against Respondent. 

By the Commission.
