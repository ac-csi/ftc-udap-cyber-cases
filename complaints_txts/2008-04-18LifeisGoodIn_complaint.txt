COMPLAINT

The Federal Trade Commission, having reason to believe that Life is good, Inc., and Life

is good Retail, Inc. (“respondents”), have violated the provisions of the Federal Trade
Commission Act, and it appearing to the Commission that this proceeding is in the public
interest, alleges:

1.

Respondent Life is good, Inc., is a Massachusetts corporation with its principal office or
place of business at 283-285 Newbury Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.  

Respondent Life is good Retail, Inc., is a Delaware corporation with its principal office or
place of business at 283-285 Newbury Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.  Life is good
Retail, Inc., is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Life is good, Inc.  

The acts and practices of respondents as alleged in this complaint are in or affecting
commerce, as “commerce” is defined in Section 4 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.

Respondents design and distribute retail apparel and accessories and operate a retail
website at www.lifeisgood.com.

Respondents operate a computer network that consumers use, in conjunction with
respondents’ website (www.lifeisgood.com) and web application, to obtain information
and to buy respondents’ products.

In selling their products, respondents routinely have collected sensitive information from
consumers, including name, address, e-mail address, phone number, credit card number,
credit card expiration date, and credit card security code (hereinafter “consumer
information”).  Respondents have collected this consumer information through their
website and telephone orders and stored it on a network computer accessible through the
website.

Since at least October 2005, respondents have disseminated or caused to be disseminated
privacy policies and statements on their website, including, but not necessarily limited to,
the following statements regarding the privacy and confidentiality of the consumer
information they collect:

We are committed to maintaining our customers’ privacy.  We collect and store
information you share with us – name, address, credit card and phone numbers –
along with information about products and services you request.  All information
is kept in a secure file and is used to tailor our communications with you.  

(Emphasis added).

Since at least October 2005, respondents have engaged in a number of practices that,
taken together, failed to provide reasonable and appropriate security for the consumer
information stored on their network, including credit card numbers, expiration dates, and
security codes.  In particular, respondents: (1) stored the consumer information in clear,
readable text; (2) created unnecessary risks to consumer information by storing it
indefinitely on their network, without a business need, and by storing credit card security
codes; (3) did not adequately assess the vulnerability of their web application and
network to commonly known or reasonably foreseeable attacks, such as “Structured
Query Language” ( “SQL”) injection attacks; (4) did not implement simple, free or low-
cost, and readily available defenses to such attacks; (5) did not use readily available
security measures to monitor and control connections from the network to the internet;
and (6) failed to employ reasonable measures to detect unauthorized access to consumer
information.

Between June and August 2006, a hacker exploited the failures set forth in Paragraph 8 by
using SQL injection attacks on respondents’ website and web application and exporting
to the hacker’s browser consumer information for thousands of customers, including
credit card numbers, expiration dates, and security codes.  After learning of the breach
from their customers, respondents took steps to prevent further unauthorized access,
notified law enforcement, and sent breach notification letters to affected customers.

Through the means described in Paragraph 7, respondents represented, expressly or by
implication, that they implemented reasonable and appropriate measures to protect
consumer information against unauthorized access.  

In truth and in fact, respondents did not implement reasonable and appropriate measures
to protect consumer information against unauthorized access.  Therefore, the
representation set forth in Paragraph 7 was, and is, false or misleading.

The acts and practices of respondents as alleged in this complaint constitute deceptive
acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal
Trade Commission Act.

THEREFORE, the Federal Trade Commission this sixteenth day of April, 2008, has

issued this complaint against respondents.

By the Commission.
