In the Matter of 

DECISION AND ORDER 

BLU PRODUCTS, INC., a corporation; and 

DOCKET NO. C-4657 

SAMUEL OHEV-ZION, individually and as 
owner and President of BLU PRODUCTS, 
INC. 

DECISION 

The Federal Trade Commission (“Commission”) initiated an investigation of certain acts 
and practices of the Respondents named in the caption.  The Commission’s Bureau of Consumer 
Protection (“BCP”) prepared and furnished to Respondents a draft Complaint.  BCP proposed to 
present the draft Complaint to the Commission for its consideration.  If issued by the 
Commission, the draft Complaint would charge Respondents with violation of the Federal Trade 
Commission Act. 

Respondents and BCP thereafter executed an Agreement Containing Consent Order 

(“Consent Agreement”).  The Consent Agreement includes:  1) statements by Respondents that 
they neither admit nor deny any of the allegations in the Complaint, except as specifically stated 
in this Decision and Order, and that only for purposes of this action, they admit the facts 
necessary to establish jurisdiction; and 2) waivers and other provisions as required by the 
Commission’s Rules. 

The Commission considered the matter and determined that it had reason to believe that 

Respondents have violated the Federal Trade Commission Act, and that a Complaint should 
issue stating its charges in that respect.  The Commission accepted the executed Consent 
Agreement and placed it on the public record for a period of 30 days for the receipt and 
consideration of public comments.  The Commission duly considered the comments received 
from interested persons pursuant to Commission Rule 2.34, 16 C.F.R. § 2.34.  Now, in further 
conformity with the procedure prescribed in Commission Rule 2.34, the Commission issues its 
Complaint, makes the following Findings, and issues the following Order:

ORDER 

Definitions 

For purposes of this Order, the following definitions apply: 

A. 

“Clearly and conspicuously” means that a required disclosure is difficult to miss (i.e., 
easily noticeable) and easily understandable by ordinary consumers, including in all of 
the following ways: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

In any communication that is solely visual or solely audible, the disclosure must 
be made through the same means through which the communication is presented.  
In any communication made through both visual and audible means, such as a 
television advertisement, the disclosure must be presented simultaneously in both 
the visual and audible portions of the communication even if the representation 
requiring the disclosure (“triggering representation”) is made through only one 
means. 

A visual disclosure, by its size, contrast, location, the length of time it appears, 
and other characteristics, must stand out from any accompanying text or other 
visual elements so that it is easily noticed, read, and understood. 

An audible disclosure, including by telephone or streaming video, must be 
delivered in a volume, speed, and cadence sufficient for ordinary consumers to 
easily hear and understand it. 

In any communication using an interactive electronic medium, such as the 
Internet or software, the disclosure must be unavoidable. 

2

6. 

7. 

8. 

The disclosure must use diction and syntax understandable to ordinary consumers 
and  must appear in each language in which the triggering representation appears. 

The disclosure must comply with these requirements in each medium through 
which it is received, including all electronic devices and face-to-face 
communications. 

The disclosure must not be contradicted or mitigated by, or inconsistent with, 
anything else in the communication. 

When the representation or sales practice targets a specific audience, such as 
children, the elderly, or the terminally ill, “ordinary consumers” includes 
reasonable members of that group. 

“Covered Device” means (a) any computing device sold by any Respondent that operates 
using an operating system, including smartphone, tablet, wearable, sensor, or any 
periphery of any portable computing device; and (b) the software used to access, operate, 
manage, or configure a device subject to part (a) of this definition, including, but not 
limited to, the firmware, web or mobile applications, and any related online services, that 
are advertised, developed, branded, or sold by any Respondent, directly or indirectly.  

“Covered Information” means the following information from or about a consumer or 
their device: (a) Geolocation Information; or (b) content of text messages, audio 
conversations, photographs, or video communications. 

“Geolocation Information” means precise location data of an individual or mobile device, 
including but not limited to GPS-based, WiFi-based, or cellular-based location 
information. 

“Personal Information” means information from or about an individual consumer or 
Covered Device, including but not limited to: (a) a first and last name; (b) a home or other 
physical address, including street name and name of city or town; (c) an email address or 
other online contact information, such as an instant messaging user identifier or a screen

credit or debit card information; (i) a persistent identifier, such as a customer number 
held in a “cookie,” a mobile device ID, or processor serial number; (j) Geolocation 
Information; (k) an authentication credential, such as a username and password; or (l) any 
other communications or content that is input into, stored on, captured with, accessed or 
transmitted through a Covered Device, including but not limited to network traffic or call 
log files, contacts, emails, text messages, photos, videos, and audio recordings.
