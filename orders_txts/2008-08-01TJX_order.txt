DECISION AND ORDER

The Federal Trade Commission, having initiated an investigation of certain acts and

practices of the Respondent named in the caption hereof, and the Respondent having been
furnished thereafter with a copy of a draft of Complaint which the Bureau of Consumer
Protection proposed to present to the Commission for its consideration and which, if issued,
would charge the Respondent with violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act; and

The Respondent and counsel for the Commission having thereafter executed an
agreement containing a consent order, an admission by the Respondent of all the jurisdictional
facts set forth in the aforesaid draft complaint, a statement that the signing of the agreement is
for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by the Respondent that the law
has been violated as alleged in such complaint, or that any of the facts as alleged in such
complaint, other than jurisdictional facts, are true, and waivers and other provisions as required
by the Commission’s Rules; and

The Commission having thereafter considered the matter and having determined that it
had reason to believe that the Respondent has violated the Federal Trade Commission Act, and
that a complaint should issue stating its charges in that respect, and having thereupon accepted
the executed consent agreement and placed such agreement on the public record for a period of
thirty (30) days for the receipt and consideration of public comments, now in further conformity
with the procedure prescribed in Section 2.34 of its Rules, 16 C.F.R. § 2.34, the Commission
hereby issues its complaint, makes the following jurisdictional findings, and enters the following
order:

dissolution of a subsidiary, parent, or affiliate that engages in any acts or practices subject to this
order; the proposed filing of a bankruptcy petition; or a change in the corporate name or address. 
Provided, however, that with respect to any proposed change in the corporation about which
respondent learns less than thirty (30) days prior to the date such action is to take place,
respondent shall notify the Commission as soon as is practicable after obtaining such knowledge.

This order will terminate on July 29, 2028, or twenty (20) years from the most recent

date that the United States or the Federal Trade Commission files a complaint (with or without
an accompanying consent decree) in federal court alleging any violation of the order, whichever
comes later; provided, however, that the filing of such a complaint will not affect the duration of:

A.

B.

C.

any Part in this order that terminates in less than twenty (20) years;

this order’s application to any respondent that is not named as a defendant in such
complaint; and

this order if such complaint is filed after the order has terminated pursuant to this
Part.

Provided, further, that if such complaint is dismissed or a federal court rules that respondent did
not violate any provision of the order, and the dismissal or ruling is either not appealed or upheld
on appeal, then the order will terminate according to this Part as though the complaint had never
been filed, except that the order will not terminate between the date such complaint is filed and

Page 5 of  6

ruling is upheld on appeal.

By the Commission.
