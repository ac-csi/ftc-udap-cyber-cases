Attachment A 

[Ring Letterhead] 

Dear Neighbor: 

On [date], we entered into a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission – the nation’s consumer 
protection agency – to resolve the FTC’s allegations that more employees and contractors than 
necessary had access to the stored videos collected by Ring cameras. The FTC alleges that several years 
ago, a limited number of employees viewed customers’ videos without their permission and without a 
business reason. These individuals are no longer employed by Ring.  

Since 2018, we have significantly changed our access and review practices. Now, only a very small 
number of employees can access videos, and only in very limited circumstances. You can learn more 
about our privacy practices at [XXX]. 

Visit [XXX] for more information about this settlement.
