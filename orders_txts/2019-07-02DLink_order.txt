for the purpose of deceiving the Assessor, Defendant shall not be deemed in compliance with 

any portion of Section I or Section II of this Order based on that Assessment.   

2. 

Defendant shall not be deemed in compliance with Section I of this Order 

based upon a Section II Assessment if Defendant materially changed its practices after the

INTERNATIONAL ELECTROTECHNICAL COMMISSION 

____________ 

SECURITY FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 
AND CONTROL SYSTEMS – 

Part 4-1: Secure product development lifecycle requirements 

FOREWORD 

1)  The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is a worldwide organization for standardization comprising 
all  national  electrotechnical  committees  (IEC  National  Committees).  The  object  of  IEC  is  to  promote 
international  co-operation  on  all  questions  concerning  standardization  in  the  electrical  and  electronic  fields.  To 
this  end  and  in  addition  to  other  activities,  IEC  publishes  International  Standards,  Technical  Specifications, 
Technical  Reports,  Publicly  Available  Specifications  (PAS)  and  Guides  (hereafter  referred  to  as  “IEC 
Publication(s)”). Their preparation is entrusted to technical committees; any IEC National Committee interested 
in  the  subject  dealt  with  may  participate  in  this  preparatory  work.  International,  governmental  and  non-
governmental  organizations  liaising  with  the  IEC  also  participate  in  this  preparation.  IEC  collaborates  closely 
with  the  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO)  in  accordance  with  conditions  determined  by 
agreement between the two organizations. 

2)  The formal decisions or agreements of IEC on technical matters express, as nearly as possible, an international 
consensus  of  opinion  on  the  relevant  subjects  since  each  technical  committee  has  representation  from  all 
interested IEC National Committees. 

3)  IEC  Publications  have  the  form  of  recommendations  for  international  use  and  are  accepted  by  IEC  National 
Committees  in  that  sense.  While  all  reasonable  efforts  are  made  to  ensure  that  the  technical  content  of  IEC 
Publications  is  accurate,  IEC  cannot  be  held  responsible  for  the  way  in  which  they  are  used  or  for  any 
misinterpretation by any end user. 

4)  In  order  to  promote  international  uniformity,  IEC  National  Committees  undertake  to  apply  IEC  Publications 
transparently  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  in  their  national  and  regional  publications.  Any  divergence 
between any IEC Publication and the corresponding national or regional publication shall be clearly indicated in 
the latter. 

5)  IEC  itself  does  not  provide  any  attestation  of  conformity.  Independent  certification  bodies  provide  conformity 
assessment  services  and,  in  some  areas,  access  to  IEC  marks  of  conformity.  IEC  is  not  responsible  for  any 
services carried out by independent certification bodies. 

6)  All users should ensure that they have the latest edition of this publication. 

7)  No  liability  shall  attach  to  IEC  or  its  directors,  employees,  servants  or  agents  including  individual  experts  and 
members of its technical committees and IEC National  Committees for any personal injury, property damage or 
other  damage  of  any  nature  whatsoever,  whether  direct  or  indirect,  or  for  costs  (including  legal  fees)  and 
expenses  arising  out  of  the  publication,  use  of,  or  reliance  upon,  this  IEC  Publication  or  any  other  IEC 
Publications. 

8)  Attention  is  drawn  to  the  Normative  references  cited  in  this  publication.  Use  of  the  referenced  publications  is 

indispensable for the correct application of this publication. 

9)  Attention  is  drawn  to  the  possibility  that  some  of  the  elements  of  this  IEC  Publication  may  be  the  subject  of 

patent rights. IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. 

International  Standard  IEC 62443-4-1  has  been  prepared  by  IEC  technical  committee  65: 
Industrial-process measurement, control and automation. 

The text of this International Standard is based on the following documents:

INTRODUCTION 

This  document  is  part  of  a  series  of  standards  that  addresses  the  issue  of  security  for 
industrial  automation  and  control  systems  (IACS).  This  document  describes  product 
development  life-cycle  requirements  related to cyber  security for  products  intended for  use  in 
the  industrial  automation  and  control  systems  environment  and  provides  guidance  on  how  to 
meet the requirements described for each element. 

This  document  has  been  developed  in  large  part  from  the  Secure  Development  Life-cycle 
Assessment  (SDLA)  Certification  Requirements  [26] 1  from  the  ISA  Security  Compliance 
Institute (ISCI). Note that the SDLA procedure was based on the following sources: 

– 

ISO/IEC 15408-3 (Common Criteria) [18]; 

–  Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Comprehensive, Lightweight Application 

Security Process (CLASP) [36]; 

–  The Security Development Life-cycle by Michael Howard and Steve Lipner [43]; 

– 

IEC 61508  Functional 
safety 
safety-related systems [24], and 

of 

electrical/electronic/ 

programmable 

electronic 

–  RCTA DO-178B Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification 

[28]. 

Therefore, all these sources can be considered contributing sources to this document. 

This  document  is  the  part  of  the  IEC 62443  series  that  contains  security  requirements  for 
developers of any automation and control products where security is a concern. 

Figure  1  illustrates  the  relationship  of  the  different  parts  of  IEC 62443  that  were  in  existence 
or  planned  as  of  the  date  of  circulation  of  this  document.  Those  that  are  normatively 
referenced  are  included  in  the  list  of  normative  references  in  Clause  2,  and  those  that  are 
referenced for informational purposes or that are in development are listed in the Bibliography.

Figure 1 – Parts of the IEC 62443 series 

Figure  2  illustrates  how  the  developed  product  relates  to  maintenance  and  integration 
capabilities  defined  in  IEC 62443-2-4  and  to  its  operation  by  the  asset  owner.  The  product 
supplier  develops  products  using  a  process  compliant  with  this  document.  Those  products 
may  be  a  single  component,  such  as  an  embedded  controller,  or  a  group  of  components 
working  together  as  a  system  or  subsystem.  The  products  are  then  integrated  together, 
usually  by  a  system  integrator,  into  an  Automation  Solution  using  a  process  compliant  with 
IEC 62443-2-4.  The  Automation  Solution  is  then  installed  at  a  particular  site  and  becomes 
part  of  the  industrial  automation  and  control  system  (IACS).  Some  of  these  capabilities 
reference  security  measures  defined  in  IEC 62443-3-3  [10]  that  the  service  provider  ensures 
are  supported  in  the  Automation  Solution  (either  as  product  features  or  compensating 
mechanisms).  This  document  only  addresses  the  process  used  for  the  development  of  the 
product;  it  does  not  address  design,  installation  or  operation  of  the  Automation  Solution  or 
IACS. 

In  Figure  2,  the  Automation  Solution  is  illustrated  to  contain  one  or  more  subsystems  and 
optional  supporting  components  such  as  advanced  control.  The  dashed  boxes  indicate  that 
these components are “optional”. 

NOTE  1  Automation  Solutions  typically  have  a  single  product,  but  they  are  not  restricted  to  do  so.  In  some 
industries, there may be a hierarchical product structure. In general, the Automation Solution is the set of hardware 
and  software,  independent  of  product  packaging,  that  is  used  to  control  a  physical  process  (for  example, 
continuous or manufacturing) as defined by the asset owner.

SECURITY FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 
AND CONTROL SYSTEMS – 

Part 4-1: Secure product development lifecycle requirements 

1  Scope 

This  part  of  IEC 62443  specifies  process  requirements  for  the  secure  development  of 
products  used  in  industrial  automation  and  control  systems.  It  defines  a  secure  development 
life-cycle (SDL) for the purpose of developing and maintaining secure products. This life-cycle 
includes  security  requirements  definition,  secure  design,  secure  implementation  (including 
coding  guidelines),  verification  and  validation,  defect  management,  patch  management  and 
product  end-of-life.  These  requirements  can  be  applied  to  new  or  existing  processes  for 
developing,  maintaining  and  retiring  hardware,  software  or  firmware  for  new  or  existing 
products. These requirements apply to the developer and maintainer of the product, but not to 
the integrator or user of the product. A summary list of the requirements in this  document can 
be found in Annex B.
