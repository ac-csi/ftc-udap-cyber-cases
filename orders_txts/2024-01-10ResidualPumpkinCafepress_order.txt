In the Matter of 

DECISION AND ORDER 

RESIDUAL PUMPKIN ENTITY, LLC, a limited 
liability company, formerly d/b/a CAFEPRESS, 
and 

DOCKET NO. C-4768

PLANETART, LLC, a limited liability company, 
d/b/a CAFEPRESS. 

DECISION 

The Federal Trade Commission (“Commission”) initiated an investigation of certain acts and 

practices of the Respondent Residual Pumpkin Entity, LLC, named in the caption.  The 
Commission’s Bureau of Consumer Protection (“BCP”) prepared and furnished to Respondent a 
draft Complaint.  BCP proposed to present the draft Complaint to the Commission for its 
consideration.  If issued by the Commission, the draft Complaint would charge Respondent with 
violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act. 

Respondent and BCP thereafter executed an Agreement Containing Consent Order (“Consent 

Agreement”).  The Consent Agreement includes:  1) statements by Respondent that it neither 
admits nor denies any of the allegations in the Complaint, except as specifically stated in this 
Decision and Order, and that only for purposes of this action, it admits the facts necessary to 
establish jurisdiction; and 2) waivers and other provisions as required by the Commission’s 
Rules. 

The Commission considered the matter and determined that it had reason to believe that 
Respondent has violated the Federal Trade Commission Act, and that a Complaint should issue 
stating its charges in that respect.  The Commission accepted the executed Consent Agreement 
and placed it on the public record for a period of 30 days for the receipt and consideration of 
public comments.  The Commission duly considered any comments received from interested 
persons pursuant to Section 2.34 of its Rules, 16 C.F.R. § 2.34.  Now, in further conformity with 
the procedure prescribed in Rule 2.34, the Commission issues its Complaint, makes the 
following Findings, and issues the following Order:

Independent Program Assessments by a Third Party

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, in connection with compliance with Provision II of

Respondent controls directly, or indirectly, in connection with the collection, maintenance, use, 
or disclosure of, or provision of access to, Personal Information must obtain initial and biennial 
assessments (“Assessments”): 

A. The Assessments must be obtained from one or more qualified, objective, independent

third-party professionals (“Assessors”), who: (1) use procedures and standards generally
accepted in the profession; (2) conduct an independent review of the Information Security
Program; (3) retain all documents relevant to each Assessment for five (5) years after

for the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the Federal Trade Commission with the name,
affiliation, and qualifications of the proposed Assessor, whom the Associate Director
shall have the authority to approve in her or his sole discretion.

II.A-J; (3) identify any gaps or weaknesses in, or instances of material noncompliance 
with, the Information Security Program; (4) address the status of gaps or weaknesses in,

explain why the evidence that the Assessor examined is (a) appropriate for assessing an 
enterprise of Respondent’s size, complexity, and risk profile; and (b) sufficient to justify 
the Assessor’s findings.  No finding of any Assessment shall rely primarily on assertions 
or attestations by Respondent’s management.  The Assessment must be signed by the 
Assessor, state that the Assessor conducted an independent review of the Information 
Security Program and did not rely primarily on assertions or attestations by Respondent’s 
management, and state the number of hours that each member of the assessment team 
worked on the Assessment.  To the extent that Respondent revises, updates, or adds one 
or more safeguards required under Provision II of this Order during an Assessment period, 
the Assessment must assess the effectiveness of the revised, updated, or added 
safeguard(s) for the time period in which it was in effect, and provide a separate statement 
detailing the basis for each revised, updated, or additional safeguard.

E. Each Assessment must be completed within sixty (60) days after the end of the reporting 
period to which the Assessment applies.  Unless otherwise directed by a Commission 
representative in writing, Respondent must submit an unredacted copy of the initial 
Assessment and a proposed redacted copy suitable for public disclosure of the initial 
Assessment to the Commission within ten (10) days after the Assessment has been

Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC  20580.  The subject 
line must begin, “In re CafePress, FTC Docket No. C-4768.”  Respondent must retain an 
unredacted copy of each subsequent biennial Assessment as well as a proposed redacted 
copy of each subsequent biennial Assessment suitable for public disclosure until the order 
is terminated and provided to the Associate Director for Enforcement within ten
(10) days of request.

C. The facts alleged in the Complaint establish all elements necessary to sustain an action by
or on behalf of the Commission pursuant to Section 523(a)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy
Code, 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(2)(A), and this Order will have collateral estoppel effect for
such purposes.

D. All money paid to the Commission pursuant to this Order may be deposited into a fund

administered by the Commission or its designee to be used for relief, including consumer
redress and any attendant expenses for the administration of any redress fund.  If a
representative of the Commission decides that direct redress to consumers is wholly or

has previously submitted to the Commission, may be used for collecting and reporting on
any delinquent amount arising out of this Order, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. § 7701.

publication on the Commission’s website (ftc.gov) as a final order. This Order will terminate 20 
years from the date of its issuance (which date may be stated at the end of this Order, near the 
Commission’s seal), or 20 years from the most recent date that the United States or the 
Commission files a complaint (with or without an accompanying settlement) in federal court 
alleging any violation of this Order, whichever comes later; provided, however, that the filing of 
such a complaint will not affect the duration of:

Provision.

Provided, further, that if such complaint is dismissed or a federal court rules that Respondent did 
not violate any provision of the Order, and the dismissal or ruling is either not appealed or 
upheld on appeal, then the Order will terminate according to this Provision as though the 
complaint had never been filed, except that the Order will not terminate between the date such 
complaint is filed and the later of the deadline for appealing such dismissal or ruling and the date

Alvaro M. Bedoya 

In the Matter of 

DECISION AND ORDER 

RESIDUAL PUMPKIN ENTITY, LLC, a limited 
liability company, formerly d/b/a CAFEPRESS, 
and 

DOCKET NO. C-4769

PLANETART, LLC, a limited liability company, 
d/b/a CAFEPRESS. 

DECISION 

The Federal Trade Commission (“Commission”) initiated an investigation of certain acts and 

practices of Respondent PlanetArt, LLC, named in the caption.  The Commission’s Bureau of 
Consumer Protection (“BCP”) prepared and furnished to Respondent a draft Complaint.  BCP 
proposed to present the draft Complaint to the Commission for its consideration.  If issued by the 
Commission, the draft Complaint would charge Respondent with violations of the Federal Trade 
Commission Act. 

Respondent and BCP thereafter executed an Agreement Containing Consent Order (“Consent 

Agreement”).  The Consent Agreement includes:  1) statements by Respondent that it neither 
admits nor denies any of the allegations in the Complaint, except as specifically stated in this 
Decision and Order, and that only for purposes of this action, it admits the facts necessary to 
establish jurisdiction; and 2) waivers and other provisions as required by the Commission’s 
Rules. 

The Commission considered the matter and determined that it had reason to believe that 
Respondent has violated the Federal Trade Commission Act, and that a Complaint should issue 
stating its charges in that respect.  The Commission accepted the executed Consent Agreement 
and placed it on the public record for a period of 30 days for the receipt and consideration of 
public comments.  The Commission duly considered any comments received from interested 
persons pursuant to Section 2.34 of its Rules, 16 C.F.R. § 2.34.  Now, in further conformity with 
the procedure prescribed in Rule 2.34, the Commission issues its Complaint, makes the 
following Findings, and issues the following Order:

assessments for (1) privacy and (2) information security from multiple Assessors, so long
as each of the Assessors meet the qualifications set forth above.

B. For each Assessment, Respondent must provide the Associate Director for Enforcement
for the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the Federal Trade Commission with the name,
affiliation, and qualifications of the proposed Assessor, whom the Associate Director
shall have the authority to approve in her or his sole discretion.

conducted) examined to make such determinations, assessments, and identifications, and 
explain why the evidence that the Assessor examined is (a) appropriate for assessing an 
enterprise of Respondent’s size, complexity, and risk profile; and (b) sufficient to justify 
the Assessor’s findings.  No finding of any Assessment shall rely primarily on assertions 
or attestations by Respondent’s management.  The Assessment must be signed by the 
Assessor, state that the Assessor conducted an independent review of the Information 
Security Program and did not rely primarily on assertions or attestations by Respondent’s 
management, and state the number of hours that each member of the assessment team 
worked on the Assessment.  To the extent that Respondent revises, updates, or adds one or 
more safeguards required under Provision II of this Order during an Assessment period, 
the Assessment must assess the effectiveness of the revised, updated, or added 
safeguard(s) for the time period in which it was in effect, and provide a separate statement 
detailing the basis for each revised, updated, or additional safeguard.

E. Each Assessment must be completed within sixty (60) days after the end of the reporting 
period to which the Assessment applies.  Unless otherwise directed by a Commission 
representative in writing, Respondent must submit an unredacted copy of the initial 
Assessment and a proposed redacted copy suitable for public disclosure of the initial 
Assessment to the Commission within ten (10) days after the Assessment has been

unredacted copy of each subsequent biennial Assessment as well as a proposed redacted 
copy of each subsequent biennial Assessment suitable for public disclosure until the order 
is terminated and provided to the Associate Director for Enforcement within ten
(10) days of request.

Exhibit A 

Subject line: Notice of FTC Settlement, 2019 Data Breach 

Dear [Customer]: 

We are contacting you about the 2019 breach of your information collected by the prior owners 
of CafePress. This notice is about that breach, which you may have already been notified of. We 
recently reached a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, the nation’s consumer 
protection agency, to resolve issues related to the 2019 data breach, and to make sure CafePress 
keeps your information safe.  

What happened? 

Before November 2019, CafePress didn’t have reasonable practices to keep your information 
safe. When the company had a security breach, the following information about you may have 
been stolen: your email address, password, name, address, phone number, [Social Security 
number or Tax Identification number], answers to your security questions, and the expiration 
date and last four digits of your credit card. 

What you can do to protect yourself 

Here are some steps to reduce the risk of identity theft and protect your information online: 

1.  Use different passwords for different accounts. That way, if one account is hacked or has a 
data breach, your other accounts will be safer. And if you’ve reused your CafePress password 
or security questions on other websites, be sure to change them right away. 

2.  Consider a password manager. These are apps that store and manage strong, unique 

passwords and security questions for all the sites you use. Search independent review sites to 
find a free or paid password manager that works for you. 

3.  Use multi-factor authentication when it’s an option. Multi-factor authentication can help 
secure your account by requiring two or more ways to verify it’s you before granting access 
to your account. This security feature makes it much harder for people to take advantage of 
stolen passwords or answers to security questions. 

4.  Learn more from the Federal Trade Commission at https://www.ftc.gov/data-breach-

resources or at https://www.IdentityTheft.gov. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at support@CafePress.com, at
